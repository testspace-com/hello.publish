# Hello Publish
This repo demostrates using `jobs`, `matrix`, and executing `multiple workflows` based on the same commit. All of the published results are aggregated together as a single result set.

[![Matrix](https://github.com/testspace-com/hello.publish/actions/workflows/matrix.yml/badge.svg?branch=multiple-workflows)](https://github.com/testspace-com/hello.publish/actions/workflows/matrix.yml) [![Jobs ](https://github.com/testspace-com/hello.publish/actions/workflows/jobs.yml/badge.svg?branch=multiple-workflows)](https://github.com/testspace-com/hello.publish/actions/workflows/jobs.yml) [![Yet Another ](https://github.com/testspace-com/hello.publish/actions/workflows/yetanother.yml/badge.svg?branch=multiple-workflows)](https://github.com/testspace-com/hello.publish/actions/workflows/yetanother.yml)

The Test Results are [here](http://testspace-com.testspace.com/projects/testspace-com:hello.publish/spaces/multiple-workflows)
